I am an Assistant Teaching Professor in the Department of Computer Science at North Carolina State University. My focus is primarily on teaching undergraduate courses, and I currently serve as the course coordinator for the CSC 111 Introduction to Computing: Python course and the E 115 Introduction to Computing Environments course. In addition to my teaching responsibilities, my research interests are in the areas of computer science education and program analysis.
