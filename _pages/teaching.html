<h2> Current Courses Taught at NCSU</h2>
<hr>

<ul>
  <li> <strong>CSC 111 Introduction to Computing: Python</strong><br>
  <p align=”justify”>CSC 111 is a mandatory course for students majoring in Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering at NCSU. 
  However, students from other majors may also take the course, with priority given to those whose curriculum includes CSC 111 as one of their options, 
  such as Statistics majors. The course serves as an introduction to computational problem-solving using Python. The course places emphasis on 
  meticulous development of Python programs based on specifications, proper programming style, accurate documentation, and appropriate utilization 
  of control structures and data types. The students will be given ample practice in writing Python programs in engineering applications. Typical enrollment is 150 students 
  in the Fall and 100 students in the Spring.<br>

  </li>
  <li> <strong>E 115 Introduction to Computing Environments</strong><br> 
  <p align=”justify”>E 115 is a mandatory introductory course for all incoming College of Engineering students at NCSU. 
  This hybrid format course equips students with essential skills and knowledge required to effectively use the computing and technology 
  resources available in the College of Engineering. The course covers topics such as accessing and using campus-based computing 
  resources and applications like campus clusters in Linux and Google tools. Students will also learn about ethics, professionalism 
  in the use of computing resources, and get an introduction to web development and other campus resources. Typical enrollment is 
  800 students per section in the Fall and 400-600 students per section in the Spring.<br>

  </li>
  <li> <strong>CSC 246 Concepts and Facilities of Operating Systems for Computer Scientists</strong><br>
  <p align=”justify”>CSC 246 is a mandatory course for Computer Science majors at NCSU aimed at providing an in-depth understanding of the design and 
  operation of operating systems along with the range of services they offer. Through this course, students will gain insight into the execution 
  environment that their programs operate in and learn how to utilize the underlying hardware effectively. The course covers several topics, 
  including Processes and Threads, CPU Scheduling, Synchronization, Memory Management, GPU Programming, Networking and Distributed Systems, 
  File Systems, as well as Protection and Security. Typical enrollment is between 90-120 students in either the Fall or Spring semester.<br>

<h2> Previous Courses Taught at W&M </h2>
<hr>

<ul>
  <li><strong>CSCI 141 Computational Problem Solving</strong></li>
  <p align=”justify”>CSCI 141 is an introductory programming course in Python designed for both computer science majors and non-majors at W&M. 
    The course aims to cover fundamental topics such as expressions, functions, conditionals, and loops, as well as object-oriented programming 
    using classes. In addition, students will learn about built-in data structures in Python, including lists, tuples, and dictionaries, 
    as well as how to develop graphics applications using PyQt5. By the end of this course, students will have acquired a solid foundation in 
    Python programming, allowing them to pursue more advanced topics in computer science.<br>
    [Spring 2018, Spring 2019, Fall 2019, Spring 2020]</p>
  <li><strong>CSCI 241 Data Structures</strong></li>
  <p align=”justify”>CSCI 241 is a required course for computer science majors at W&M that builds upon fundamental concepts introduced in previous 
    coursework. The course aims to provide a deeper understanding of data abstraction, data structures, and data representation. Topics covered in 
    the course include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, balanced trees, priority queues, hashing, and their respective applications. 
    By the end of this course, students will have a solid foundation in data structures and their use in solving complex computing problems.<br>
    [Fall 2016, Spring 2017, Fall 2017]</p>
  <li><strong>CSCI 243 Discrete Structures of CSCI</strong></li>
  <p align=”justify”>CSCI 243 is a computer science course designed for W&M majors that focuses on introducing the theoretical foundations of the 
    discipline. The course covers a wide range of topics, including logic, proof methods, sets, functions, sequences, algorithm complexity, 
    induction, recursion, discrete probability, trees, and graphs. By exploring these fundamental concepts, students will gain a deeper understanding 
    of the principles underlying computer science and be better equipped to tackle complex computing problems.<br>
