<ul>
  <li> <strong>CSC 111 Introduction to Computing: Python</strong><br>
  <p align=”justify”>CSC 111 is a mandatory course for students majoring in Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering at NCSU. 
  However, students from other majors may also take the course, with priority given to those whose curriculum includes CSC 111 as one of their options, 
  such as Statistics majors. The course serves as an introduction to computational problem-solving using Python. The course places emphasis on 
  meticulous development of Python programs based on specifications, proper programming style, accurate documentation, and appropriate utilization 
  of control structures and data types. The students will be given ample practice in writing Python programs in engineering applications. Typical enrollment is 150 students 
  in the Fall and 100 students in the Spring.<br>

  <li> <strong>E 115 Introduction to Computing Environments</strong><br> 
  <p align=”justify”>E 115 is a mandatory introductory course for all incoming College of Engineering students at NCSU. 
  This hybrid format course equips students with essential skills and knowledge required to effectively use the computing and technology 
  resources available in the College of Engineering. The course covers topics such as accessing and using campus-based computing 
  resources and applications like campus clusters in Linux and Google tools. Students will also learn about ethics, professionalism 
  in the use of computing resources, and get an introduction to web development and other campus resources. Typical enrollment is 
  800 students per section in the Fall and 400-600 students per section in the Spring.<br>
