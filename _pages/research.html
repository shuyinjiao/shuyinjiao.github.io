<h3>Critical Path Course Redesign of CSC 111 Introduction to Computing: Python</h3>
<p><strong>Funding</strong>: NC State DELTA Course Redesign Grant [<span>&#36;</span>21,156 (2021-2022) + <span>&#36;</span>10,250 (2022-2023)], 
  <br>Scholarship of Teaching and Learning Institute Grant[<span>&#36;</span>1,250 (2022-2023)]</p>
<p><strong>Principal Investigator</strong>: Shuyin Jiao</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: CSC 111 is a required course for students majoring in Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering, 
  and it is also open to students in other majors. The course is offered every Fall/Spring semester, with typical class enrollments ranging 
  between 90 and 150 students. Due to the large class size and the difficulty of the course subject, several instructional challenges need 
  to be addressed, including keeping every student engaged throughout the lecture, reducing the DFUW rate, grading programming assignments 
  consistently and efficiently while providing high-quality feedback, and stimulating the interest of students who are not majoring in 
  Computer Science. The goal of this project is to address these challenges and improve the overall quality of instruction. 
  We anticipate that students will be more engaged in class, have a better understanding of the course content, achieve grades above the C- wall, 
  and be more confident in completing every step of the programming process independently, including designing algorithms and writing, testing, 
  and debugging programs in Python.
