<h3>Critical Path Course Redesign of CSC 111: Introduction to Computing - Python</h3>
<p><strong>Funding:</strong> NC State DELTA Course Redesign Grant [$21,156 (2021-2022) + $10,250 (2022-2023)]</p>
<p><strong>Principal Investigator:</strong> Shuyin Jiao</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> CSC 111 is a required course for students majoring in Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering, 
and it is also open to students in other majors. The course is offered every Fall/Spring semester, with typical class enrollments ranging between 90 and 
150 students.

Due to the large class size and the difficulty of the course subject, there are several instructional challenges that need to be addressed. 
These include keeping every student engaged throughout the lecture, reducing the rate of students dropping/failing/withdrawing (DFUW rates), 
grading programming assignments consistently and efficiently while providing high-quality feedback, and stimulating the interest of students 
who are not majoring in Computer Science.

The goal of this project is to address these challenges and improve the overall quality of instruction. We anticipate that students will be more engaged
in class, have a better understanding of the course contents, achieve grades above the C- wall, and be more confident in completing every step of 
the programming process independently, including designing algorithms and writing/testing/debugging programs in Python.
